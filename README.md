# Design Process

The design process for this quiz is centered around a soothing green color theme. A lighter shade was selected to provide contrast with the black font, while a bright red color was used to draw the user's attention to the time limit displayed on the rules page.

To help guide the design process, a list of user stories is provided, detailing the existing and potential features of the quiz. Currently, the quiz includes two existing features:

Results display - users can see their score at the end of the quiz
Correct answer display - the correct answer is highlighted in green with a green tick, indicating its correctness
